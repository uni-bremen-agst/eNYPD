*eNYPD* is a research prototype of the [Software Engineering Group](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/st?v=2&cHash=4ad0bf1d7d37aa3e95817001edef3ea5)
at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en). It was published at [SCAM'21](http://www.ieee-scam.org/2021/)
and helps to automatically extract information on application entry-points. Application entry-points are methods that
can be called by, for instance, external users. This information is crucial for many security-related analyses.
