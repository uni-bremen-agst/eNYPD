* Abstract 

The architectural phases ist an important part of the Software developement. One of the developerâ€™s task is to implement the software
designed. However, the abstract aspect of the design leaves a very
surprising difference between the software product and the architecture. Several approaches have been developed to compare the
final software and architecture. In this paper one of them catches
our attention notably the static code analysis. However, the static
code analysis encounters a problem for its proper functioning, notably the determination of the entry points in web applications.
This paper offers an application to generate entry points into a web
application in order to be used for code analysis.
